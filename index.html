    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Our aim is simple, let us give names to the full moons of Miami.</p>
    <p>The names used by the rest of the country are culturally, climatically and ecologically ill suited for Miami</p>
    <p>What does a "corn moon" mean to us? A "beaver moon"? </p>
    <p>The full moon is associated with madness and with romance. Is there a more mad, more romantic city than Miami?</p>
    <p>Lets plumb the depths of our incredible variety of culture, of nature, of life itself, and bequeth names to our full moons that hold meaning and capture our city's spirit</p>
