    <h1>About this Project</h1>
    <p>
      Help us give names to Miami's full moons. The names we often use for full moons come from traditions and cultures of other parts of the world 
      and do not reflect Miami, its people and its environment. What does a "corn moon", or a "buck moon" or a "sturgeon moon" mean to us? Let's give
      each full moon its own identity that reflects on the place you call home.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In <strong>Phase 1</strong>, you can suggest names for
      all twelve months (and add a short explanation if you’d like). In <strong>Phase 2</strong>, we’ll
      open up voting to pick the favorites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the buttons above to jump to <em>Phase 1: Nominations</em> or check back for
      <em>Phase 2: Voting</em> once nominations wrap.
